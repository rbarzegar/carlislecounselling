               <p>“Carlisle School Counselling Service has been a godsend for us, providing a service that we were unable to
                  source elsewhere and giving pupils access to well trained professionals. A big plus of the service is that
                  the pupil is allocated a counsellor really quickly so that timely support that is so crucially needed is
                  there when they require it. The skills of the counsellors facilitate good relationships between staff so
                  that we can constantly feed back and liaise vital information and most importantly they are able to build
                  up the trust with the pupil. So much so that the pupil wants to contact them and can open up about everything.
                  The impact that the service has upon pupils is immense and I can't thank you enough. It has significantly
                  improved the mental well being of the pupils. The staff also are willing to go the extra mile, for example
                  by attending meetings.”
